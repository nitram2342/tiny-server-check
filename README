Simple one script fits all service monitoring.

No, not really, usually I use Munin for monitoring, but for certain critical
systems or for infrastructure my Munin instance depends on, I want to receive
an SMS. Configuration is done in the included config.inc. Just have a look.

Installation
------------

1. Install the SMS helper tool or adjust the scripts code to support your tool:

$ sudo pip install git+https://github.com/nitram2342/simple-fax-sms

2. Follow instructions in the header section of tiny-server-check.sh.
